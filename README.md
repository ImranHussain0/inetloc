# Inetloc POCs

Files with the extension of *inetloc, filoc, url,* or *webloc*, can execute arbitary commands on Mac OS. This is a risk as these files could be sent to an unsuspecting user by email, fileshare, or similar. It is difficult for EDR/AV solutions to screen for these as legitimate applications make use of them.

This vulnerbiltity is old now but suprisingly still has not completely patched by the vendor.

This repo just contains some POCs that I made for test purposes.<br>
Do not use them for any thing illegal.
